/*
	Updatable View (virtual table)
	1. It is possible to update,Insert and delete record on Base table with views.

	2. We can create view with multiple table.
	


	Conclusion:

	If a view is based on multiple tables, and if we update a view, it may not update the underlying base tables correctly.
	To correctly update a view, that is based on multiple table, INSTEAD OF trigger is used.

-- Create a Department table

-- Create Employee details

						Gender nvarchar(10),
						DepartmentId int,
						constraint FK_Employee_Department_tbl_By_ID foreign key (DepartmentId) references  Department_tbl(departId)

Create View vWEmployeeDataExceptSalary

-- # 1.1
-- Update base table with view (1 base table) 

update vWEmployeeDataExceptSalary

-- innsert record into base table with view (1 base table)
Insert into vWEmployeeDataExceptSalary (Name, Gender, DepartmentId) values ('Ritika', 'Female', 5)

-- #2
-- Create View with 2 base table to fetch data 

Create view vWEmployeesByDepartment
as
select Id,Name, Salary, Gender, d.department_Name

go

-- fetch records using view
select * from vWEmployeesByDepartment

go



--#2.1
-- update with view with multiple  base table.
update vWEmployeesByDepartment 
set department_Name= 'IT' where Name= 'Ram'			-- 1 row effected 


select * from vWEmployeesByDepartment

-- But when fetch all data we found that all HR rows become IT. (like rabina record)

-- check the base table
select * from Department_tbl
select* from Employee_tbl


-- We found that, after update a record using view above, its update the DepartmentName HR to IT and all employee with HR become IT.

-- To prevent above issue, we use INSTEAD OF trigger.
